## Want to help?

1. Consider pursuing something you're interested in, and sharing that journey online.
2. If 1. is too vague and you want something more specific
        , read [Friendly Ambitious Nerd] and [Introspect]
        , then revisit 1.
3. A [Babashka pod] for [Pandoc].
4. Dig into the [play.teod.eu source] to understand the page-oriented information model.
   Then consider making your own idea playground to support your aesthetic.
